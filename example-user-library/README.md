## A Tool for Complex and Scalable Data Access Policy Enforcement

# Example User Library
Each of these users is defined as an ExampleUser which is a specialisation of the [Palisade-common](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-common/README.md) User class.
These are accompanied by key attributes that defined the properties of the users in the working example.
These include:
    Purpose which defines the reason a query is being made
    Role which defines the department that an employee work in
    Training Course which list the formal training course that an employee has completed
With this example of a user, we are able to demonstrate the ease it is to apply the existing concept of a Palisade user to fit the requirements of a business. 

For a full explanation of how this library is used in context to the example is described in the [Overview of the Example](./README.md).
