# Examples

The example demonstrates different users querying an avro file over a REST api.

The Examples module contains all example specific modules as follows:

### [HR Data Generator](hr-data-generator/README.md)
The queried files are a generated HR dataset of Employee records, generated by the *HR Data Generator*.
This is a tool for creating a fake sample dataset based around possible data that a company might hold about its employees.
Provides the `Employee` datatype and its associated members, as well as a configurable random generator of such Employee objects.

### [Example Library](example-library/README.md)
The policies applied when running the example are a collection of static coarse-grained (resource-level) and fine-grained (record-level) rules that can be found in the *Example Library*, and are used for prepopulating the palisade services with data.
This collection of example-specific rules, types and configurations is based around the possible policies a company might set out for users accessing sensitive employee data, depending upon their role in the company.
Provides the `ExampleUser` datatype specialisation of the [Palisade-common](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-common) `User`, as well as Rules to be used for policy setting.

### [Example Runner](example-runner/README.md)
The example scenarios can be run using the Spring Boot REST client application in the *Example Runner*, requesting and reading for a number of different users, resources and contexts.
This simple Spring Boot application has a number of different runners for such REST clients, which also manage using the palisade-service response to connect to the appropriate data-service.
Provides an `ExampleSimpleClient` specialisation of the Palisade-clients `SimpleClient` for making REST requests for Employee avro data.

### [Performance](performance/README.md)
The performance of the palisade services compared to native file reads (and other metrics) can be measured using the *Performance* testing suite.
This performance-testing suite has a number of different trial types, datasets and policy variants to cover a reasonable number of common use-cases.

### [Deployment](deployment)
Contains all the deployment specific code and scripts. Current deployment targets are:
* [Local JVM Processes](./deployment/local-jvm/README.md)
* [Docker/Kubernetes Containers](./deployment/local-k8s/README.md)

Since scripts are all `.sh` files, the [services-manager](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade-services/blob/develop/services-manager/README.md) may be preferred for cross-platform compatibility.
